# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AppSync GraphQL API infrastructure to connect frontend applications to the existing ECS-based multi-agent system. The solution provides a scalable, real-time interface that routes requests through a supervisor agent to specialized sub-agents for customer support operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to interact with the multi-agent system through a GraphQL API, so that I can build responsive user interfaces with real-time capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GraphQL query is sent to AppSync THEN the system SHALL route the request to the appropriate Lambda resolver
2. WHEN the Lambda resolver processes a request THEN it SHALL communicate with the existing ECS supervisor agent via HTTP
3. WHEN a GraphQL subscription is established THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates for chat messages and agent status changes
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate JWT tokens through Cognito user pools

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the GraphQL API to integrate seamlessly with existing ECS infrastructure, so that I can maintain current agent deployments without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda functions are deployed THEN they SHALL run in the same VPC as existing ECS services
2. WHEN Lambda communicates with ECS services THEN it SHALL use proper security group configurations and network access
3. WHEN service discovery is configured THEN Lambda SHALL resolve ECS service endpoints dynamically
4. IF load balancers are present THEN Lambda SHALL communicate through the existing ALB configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer support agent, I want real-time chat functionality through the GraphQL API, so that I can provide immediate assistance to customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat message is sent THEN the system SHALL store it in DynamoDB with proper session management
2. WHEN a message is processed by agents THEN subscribers SHALL receive real-time updates via GraphQL subscriptions
3. WHEN multiple agents are involved THEN the system SHALL aggregate responses and maintain conversation context
4. WHEN agent status changes THEN connected clients SHALL receive immediate notifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability, so that I can maintain system reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL include CloudWatch metrics for all components
2. WHEN requests flow through the system THEN X-Ray SHALL provide distributed tracing
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate alerts and notifications
4. WHEN performance issues arise THEN monitoring SHALL provide actionable insights for troubleshooting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want proper authentication and authorization controls, so that I can ensure secure access to the multi-agent system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the API THEN they SHALL authenticate through Cognito user pools
2. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions for specific operations
3. WHEN the API is exposed THEN WAF SHALL protect against common web attacks
4. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce user-specific data isolation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable error handling and circuit breaker patterns, so that the system remains stable under various failure conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ECS services are unavailable THEN the circuit breaker SHALL prevent cascading failures
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms
3. WHEN timeouts happen THEN users SHALL receive appropriate error messages
4. WHEN partial failures occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the infrastructure to be defined as code, so that deployments are repeatable and version-controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure is deployed THEN it SHALL use AWS CDK for all resource definitions
2. WHEN changes are made THEN they SHALL be tracked through version control
3. WHEN environments are created THEN they SHALL use consistent configuration patterns
4. WHEN resources are provisioned THEN they SHALL follow AWS best practices for security and performance
