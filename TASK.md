## üîß Implementation Specifics

### Agent Business Logic (from AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

#### Supervisor Agent
- **Intent Analysis**: Determine customer's primary objective
- **Agent Selection**: Route to appropriate specialized agents
- **Execution Coordination**: Manage sequential/parallel delegation
- **Response Synthesis**: Combine outputs into cohesive answers
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation history

#### Order Management Agent
- **Order Status Tracking**: Retrieve current order status
- **Inventory Management**: Check product availability
- **Return/Exchange Processing**: Handle returns and exchanges
- **Order History Analysis**: Provide historical information

#### Product Recommendation Agent
- **Purchase History Analysis**: Review past purchases
- **Product Catalog Querying**: Access details, ratings, pricing
- **Customer Feedback Integration**: Incorporate unstructured feedback
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generate tailored suggestions

#### Troubleshooting Agent
- **Issue Diagnosis**: Identify common problems
- **Solution Retrieval**: Find relevant troubleshooting steps
- **Product-Specific Guidance**: Category-specific troubleshooting
- **Warranty Information**: Access warranty and support details

#### Personalization Agent
